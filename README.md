Who am I?
Hello my name is Jelle Kuiper and I am, at the time of updating this Text, 24 years old. What I like doing most in a day is programming, beatboxing, gaming, watching YouTube/movies/series, cycling, trampolining and hanging out with my girlfriend/friends.

Furthermore, I have a good eye for detail and a methodical work ethic since I:
- 5 years working at a McDonald's;
- Worked at restaurant the Echoput for 3 years;
- Did 3 years of MBO-ICT including internships;
- Did about 4 years of HBO-ICT.

Here I also learned other qualities such as efficiency, perseverance, purposefulness and solution orientation. Learning, asking questions and taking criticism have also improved over time so I can pick up new things quickly as well. These skills have become a way of life that I now handle with passion.

I am currently studying HBO-ICT at Saxion in Deventer.
